## Handling Large Files

Large files, such as those in `data/4.processed/` and all `.parquet` files, are excluded from version control using `.gitignore`. If you need these files, please request access or download them from the shared cloud storage link provided by the project maintainer. This approach avoids git storage limits and keeps the repository lightweight.
